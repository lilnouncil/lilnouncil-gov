## Voting

### Voting Options:

All polls in `#lil-nouncil-votes` have the following options: `FOR`, `AGAINST`, or a **Lil Nouncillor** can abstain.

### Voting Period:

All Lil Nouncil polls are open for five days (120 hours), after which voting will close. Late votes will not be accepted.

### Voting Quorum: 

The minimum number of Lil Nouncilors needed to vote on a proposal for a decision to be made. 
Abstains count towards quorum. A vote that fails to meet the quorum is null and void.

Current Voting Quorum: 30%

### Vote Threshold:

In addition to meeting quorum, for a poll to succeed, the leading option must have a minimum of 30% support. 
This includes both `FOR` and `AGAINST` options. If the voting threshold is not met, the poll is inconclusive.

Current Vote Threshold: 21%

### Changing Votes

If a Lil Nouncillor has voted on a poll and wants to change their vote before it closes, 
they can DM [Joel Cares](https://discord.com/users/362737590430072862) to delete their old vote. 
This can only be done once per poll, and they are responsible for processing their updated vote.

### Voting Results:

If the quorum is not met, a poll is inconclusive.

If no option reaches the Vote Threshold, the poll is inconclusive.
For example, if we have 100 Lil Nouncillors, a vote option such as `FOR` needs 30 or more supporting votes to succeed, 
even if it is the option with the highest votes.

If a poll results in a tie, it is inconclusive.
Inconclusive polls will be processed as `ABSTAIN` in external governance, such as Lil Nouns DAO.
If a vote meets the quorum, a single vote option has the most votes, and those votes meet or pass the Vote Threshold, 
that vote option will be considered the winner in a binding Nouncil decision.


## Members

### Eligibility:

To be eligible for membership in Lil Nouncil, an individual must demonstrate a track record of Nounish Building.

### New Members:

New members can join the Nouncil Discussion Channel anytime and engage in (respectful) dialog and discussion.

To join Lil Nouncil, you must head to [Lil Nouns Discord](https://discord.gg/zXPSZj7zSb) and, in the `#lil-nouncil-chat` channel, ask to join Nouncil. 
Please include a summary of your Nounish activities and any relevant social media links.

Any Lil Nouncillor can sign an application to vote using the command `/nerman create-poll` in `#lil-nouncil-votes`. 
Nomination polls must clearly state who is applying, tag them, and link to their application message.

When voting on a new member, Lil Nouncillors should evaluate the application on the following criteria:

- Are they a Nounish builder?
- Have they shipped or worked on any Nounish projects/products?
- Do they have a track record of execution?
- Are they unique person and not an alternate account for any existing Nouncillor?

### Removal of Members: 

Should it be appropriate to remove a member of the Lil Nouncil due to behavior unbecoming a Lil Nouncillor or project termination, 
any two members of the Lil Nouncil can suggest the removal of said member, which will then be put to a binding Nouncil vote. 
Removing a Nouncillor requires a majority decision (> 51% of Lil Nouncillors)

### Lil Nouns DAO Proposals: 

The Lil Nouncil shall endeavor to discuss and vote on every proposal made at [Lil Nouns Governance](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote). 

### Prop House

If a. Lil Nouncillor has a proposal in a [Prop House](https://prop.house/) that the Lil Nouncil is voting on, they should vote however they want, including for their proposal.

### Active Nouncillor

An Active Lil Nouncillor is a Lil Nouncillor who has a vote participation rate of 50% or greater and has been active in Lil Nouncil for at least two months.
This status will be used to determine eligibility for various grant programs. 
For instance, only Active Nouncillors are eligible for the regular Community Grants allocations.

### Minimum Vote Participation Rate

Current Minimum Vote Participation Rate: 20%

If a Nouncillorâ€™s vote participation falls below the minimum, they will be automatically removed from the Nouncil. 
They can apply again anytime, but all Nouncil voting records will start from scratch.

### Presence in Discord

It is not currently possible to participate in Nouncil without being a member of the Nouncil Discord server. 
As such, leaving the Nouncil Discord is equivalent to resigning from Nouncil.

If a Lil Nouncillor leaves the Lil Nouns Discord, they have seven days to rejoin and contact an admin to restore their Nouncillor role. 
After seven days, they will be removed from Nouncil entirely and must reapply to join.
